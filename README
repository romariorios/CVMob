CVMob - Movement analysis tool
Copyright (C) 2012-2015  The CVMob contributors

#### THIS SOFTWARE IS UNDER HEAVY DEVELOPMENT AND NOT USABLE YET ####

Requires:
 - OpenCV (>= 2.0)
   - http://opencv.org/
 - Qt (Core Gui Widgets LinguistTools* >= 5.0)
   - http://qt-project.org/
 - KF5ItemModels >= 5.0
   - http://download.kde.org/stable/frameworks/5.7/kitemmodels-5.7.0.zip
   (latest version)
 - CMake* (>= 2.8.12)
   - http://www.cmake.org/

 * Build-time only dependencies

Notes about the dependencies:
If you use Linux, OpenCV 2, Qt 5 and KF5 are available for installation in most
distributions.

Aside from that, if you intend to use the opencv provided by your distro,
note that some ship a version of libopencv compiled with no FFMPEG support,
relying solely on GStreamer, which may be problematic -- it may be unable
to, i.e., seek and gather length information from videos, basically killing
the application. If in doubt, compile opencv.

If you're using Windows, I advise you to, first, download and install the Qt
SDK and CMake, and work your way to compile OpenCV and KItemModels from there.
To compile KItemModels, you need to know that the KF5Config.cmake require by
it is inside KF5Umbrella.

Build instructions:
If you have OpenCV, Qt and KF5 in your path, you can configure the
project simply by running:

    cmake .

inside the src/ directory.

However, if you have a custom installation of OpenCV, you may have to
modify the command above to:

    cmake . -DOpenCV_DIR=/path/to/opencv/share/OpenCV/

If Qt is not in your path, the easiest way to tell CMake where it is,
is to set CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH to the Qt 5 prefix:

    cmake . -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/qt5

Of course, if neither of Qt and OpenCV is in your path, you'll have to
combine both commands above:

    cmake . -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/qt5 \
            -DOpenCV_DIR=/path/to/opencv/share/OpenCV

To tell CMake where KItemModels is, you have to set KF5ItemModels_DIR
to where you built KItemModels:

    cmake . -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/qt5 \
            -DOpenCV_DIR=/path/to/opencv/share/OpenCV \
            -DKF5ItemModels_DIR=/path/to/kitemmodels/lib/cmake/KF5ItemModels

To know the actual directories, you have to look for KF5ItemModelsConfig.cmake.

After configuring CVMob a Makefile will be generated. To build that
Makefile, just run make:

    make

You can make the compilation faster by adding the -jn argument to make,
being n the number of threads make will run (usually, a sane number is
the number of threads you processor supports plus 1):

    make -j5

After that, a cvmob executable will appear in the src folder and then you
can simply run it. Enjoy!
