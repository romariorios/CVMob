CVMob - Movement analysis tool
Copyright (C) 2012-2014  The CVMob contributors

#### THIS SOFTWARE IS UNDER HEAVY DEVELOPMENT AND NOT USABLE YET ####

Requires:
 * OpenCV (>= 2.0)
 * Qt (>= 5.0)
 * CMake (>= 2.8.6, for build only)

Note: A Qt 4.6 version of this software can be found at the qt4
branch, but it's long unmaintained and severely outdated. You can try
to compile the master branch using Qt 4, but the code now uses quite
a few Qt5- (and C++11-) only features, so you'll have to port those.

Build instructions:
If you have both OpenCV and Qt in your path, you can configure the
project simply by running:

    cmake .

inside the src/ directory.

However, if you have a custom installation of OpenCV, you may have to
modify the command above to:

    cmake . -DOpenCV_DIR=/path/to/opencv/share/OpenCV/

If Qt is not in your path, the easiest way to tell CMake where it is,
is to set CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH to the Qt 5 prefix:

    cmake . -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/qt5

Of course, if neither of Qt and OpenCV is in your path, you'll have to
combine both commands above:

    cmake . -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/qt5 \
            -DOpenCV_DIR=/path/to/opencv/share/OpenCV

If you use Linux and intend to use the opencv provided by your distro,
note that some distros ship a version of libopencv compiled with no
FFMPEG support, relying solely on GStreamer, which may be problematic --
it may be unable to, i.e., seek and gather length information from videos,
basically killing the application. If in doubt, compile opencv.

After configuring CVMob a Makefile will be generated. To build that
Makefile, just run make:

    make

You can make the compilation faster by adding the -jn argument to make,
being n the number of threads make will run (usually, a sane number is
the number of threads you processor supports plus 1):

    make -j5

After that, a cvmob executable will appear in the src folder and then you
can simply run it. Enjoy!
